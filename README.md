# Introuction-to-Machine-Learning-workshop

### Linear Regression and Kmeans clustering notebook:
- In this workshop, my team and I taught the intricacies of machine learning, including important concepts like overfitting, underfitting, and gradient descent.
- We dived deep into the mathematics of gradient descent, showing a step process of how gradient descent works in both linear regression and Kmeans clustering.

### EDA and Kmeans clustering notebook:
- This notebook displays the entire machine learning workflow from gathering data to getting predictions from a trained model.
- We covered the basics of Exploratory data analysis and training a K-means clustering model in scikit-learn.
